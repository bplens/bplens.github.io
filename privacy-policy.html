    <h1>BP Lens Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="last-updated">Last Updated: March 22, 2025</p>

    <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
    <p>BP Lens ("we," "our," or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and safeguard your information when you use our productivity application for digitizing numerical readings.</p>

    <h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>
    <h3>2.1 Camera Data</h3>
    <p>We use your device's camera to capture numerical readings from physical displays. The camera is only used when you actively choose to digitize a reading. The captured images are temporarily processed for text recognition using artificial intelligence services and are immediately deleted after processing. No images are stored on our servers.</p>

    <h3>2.2 OCR Data</h3>
    <p>We use artificial intelligence services for OCR (Optical Character Recognition) processing. Currently, this is provided by OpenAI's GPT service. The images are only processed for text recognition and are immediately deleted after processing. We do not store any images or OCR results on our servers.</p>

    <h3>2.3 Storage Access</h3>
    <p>We access your device storage only when you choose to import or export your records.</p>

    <h2>3. Advertising</h2>
    <p>We use AdMob to display advertisements. AdMob may collect and process data as described in their privacy policy: <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy">Google Privacy Policy</a></p>

    <h2>4. Data Storage and Retention</h2>
    <p>Your digitized readings are stored locally on your device only. We do not store any data on our servers:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>All data is stored only on your device</li>
        <li>Images are processed online but never stored</li>
        <li>No data is collected for service improvement</li>
        <li>You have complete control over your data</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. Data Export</h2>
    <p>You can export your data in CSV or JSON formats. You are responsible for the security of exported data files.</p>

    <h2>6. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>Our app uses the following third-party services:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Google AdMob for advertising</li>
        <li>OpenAI GPT for OCR processing</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>7. Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>Our app is not intended for children under 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13.</p>

    <h2>8. Changes to Privacy Policy</h2>
