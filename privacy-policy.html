    <h1>BP Lens Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="last-updated">Last Updated: April 20, 2025</p>

    <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      BP Lens ("we," "our," or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy.
      This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and safeguard your
      information when you use our productivity application for digitizing
      numerical readings.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>
    <h3>2.1 Camera Data</h3>
    <p>
      We use your device's camera to capture numerical readings from physical
      displays. The camera is only used when you actively choose to digitize a
      reading. The captured images are processed for text recognition using
      artificial intelligence services. For quality improvement purposes, we may
      store anonymized images on our servers for up to 1 month before deletion.
      These stored images are not tied to any individual user.
    </p>

    <h3>2.2 OCR Data</h3>
    <p>
      We use artificial intelligence services for OCR (Optical Character
      Recognition) processing. Currently, this is provided by OpenAI's GPT
      service. The images are processed for text recognition. For quality
      improvement, we may store anonymized images for up to 1 month before
      deletion. These stored images are not tied to any individual user.
    </p>

    <h3>2.3 Storage Access</h3>
    <p>
      We access your device storage only when you choose to import or export
      your records.
    </p>

    <h2>3. Advertising</h2>
    <p>
      We use AdMob to display advertisements. AdMob may collect and process data
      as described in their privacy policy:
      <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy">Google Privacy Policy</a>
    </p>

    <h2>4. Data Storage and Retention</h2>
    <p>
      Your digitized readings are stored locally on your device. For quality
      improvement purposes, we may store anonymized images on our servers for up
      to 1 month before deletion:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>All personal data is stored only on your device</li>
      <li>Images may be stored temporarily for service improvement</li>
      <li>Stored images are anonymized and deleted within 1 month</li>
      <li>You have complete control over your personal data</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. Data Export</h2>
    <p>
      You can export your data in CSV format. You are responsible for the
      security of exported data files.
    </p>

    <h2>6. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>Our app uses the following third-party services:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Google AdMob for advertising</li>
      <li>OpenAI GPT for OCR processing</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>7. Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>
      Our app is not intended for children under 13. We do not knowingly collect
      personal information from children under 13.
    </p>

    <h2>8. Changes to Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>
      We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of
      any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page.
